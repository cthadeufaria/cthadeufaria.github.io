## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Master's graduate in Electrical and Computer Engineering from FEUP, specialized in **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Hardware Systems**. My work blends advanced deep learning (including transformers and large language models) with **Rust-powered real-time pipelines** for production-grade applications.

My background spans:
- Real-time inference systems in Rust  
- Video quality monitoring with transformer architectures  
- Embedded systems and sensor-driven hardware  
- Prototyping and industrial communication with Raspberry Pi
