## Published Paper

### _AI-Driven Media Quality Monitoring System_

This work presents a full-stack implementation of a **dual-stage attention neural network** for **no-reference video quality assessment**, integrated into a real-time media processing system using **Rust and GStreamer**.

The system achieves sub-second inference latency and demonstrates strong perceptual alignment on the LIVE-NFLX-II dataset. It offers a practical framework for real-time monitoring of streaming media quality.
